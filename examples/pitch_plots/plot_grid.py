Grid
====

The grid method provides a convenient way to plot multiple pitches in the same figure.
Unfortunately, it is often hard to control the space between pitches through
Matplotlib's plt.subplots (via the Pitch's draw method).
You have to use trial and error to get a figure looking right.

The grid method makes your life easier; you can fix the space between pitches.
It then automatically calculates the pitch placement and the correct figure width.
I also added the option of including a title_ax and endnote_ax, which align to the pitch sides.

This example takes you through the basics of how the grid method works and then
shows a more complicated example copied
from `Brad (@DymondFormation) <https://twitter.com/DymondFormation>`_ and using
the `highlight_text package <https://github.com/znstrider/highlight_text>`_
by `@danzn1 <https://twitter.com/danzn1>`_.

Pitch Types
===========

A key design principle of mplsoccer is to support 
different data providers by changing the ``pitch_type`` argument.

The current supported pitch types are printed below.

# StatsBomb
# ---------
# The default pitch is `StatsBomb <https://statsbomb.com/>`_
# The xaxis limits are 0 to 120 and the yaxis limits are 80 to 0 (inverted).

##############################################################################
# Tracab
# ------
# `Tracab <https://tracab.com/>`_ are centered pitches for tracking data.
# The xaxis limits are -pitch_length/2 * 100 to pitch_length/2 * 100.
# The yaxis limits are -pitch_width/2 * 100 to pitch_width/2 * 100.

# Opta
# ----
# `Opta data from Stats Perform <https://www.statsperform.com/opta/>`_ has
# both the x and y limits between 0 and 100.
# Opta pitch coordinates are used by

# Standardized coordinates
# ------------------------
# Mplsoccer version 1.3.0 onwards also allows custom dimensions
# to be passed to the ``pitch_type`` argument.
# It is common in some machine learning methods to standardize values, e.g. coordinates.
# However, you might still want to plot the standardized coordinates to check your transforms work.
# You can use the center_scale_dims function to create custom centered pitch dimensions
# and pass this to the ``pitch_type`` argument.
# Below we create a pitch with limits between -1 and 1 (``width``/2 and ``length``/2).
# You can also change the ``width`` and ``length`` arguments to get different pitch limits.
# The visual layout of the pitch is controlled by the ``pitch_width`` and ``pitch_length``
# arguments.
from mplsoccer.soccer.dimensions import center_scale_dims
from mplsoccer import Pitch
dim = center_scale_dims(pitch_width=68, pitch_length=105,
                        width=2, length=2, invert_y=False)
pitch = Pitch(pitch_type=dim, label=True, axis=True)
fig, ax = pitch.draw()

##############################################################################
# Other custom dimensions
# -----------------------
# Aditionally, you can create your own arbitrary dimensions.
# See the `mplsoccer.dimensions module <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewRowlinson/mplsoccer/main/mplsoccer/dimensions.py>`_
# for examples of how to define the dimensions. 
# The custom dimensions object must be a subclass of ``mplsoccer.dimensions.BaseDims``
# and can then be passed to the ``pitch_type`` argument.

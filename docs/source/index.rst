**mplsoccer is a Python library for plotting soccer/football charts in Matplotlib and
loading StatsBomb open-data.**

-----------
Quick start
-----------

Use the package manager `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ to install mplsoccer.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mplsoccer

Or install via `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge mplsoccer

Plot a StatsBomb pitch:

.. code-block:: python

    from mplsoccer import Pitch
    pitch = Pitch(pitch_color='grass', line_color='white', stripe=True)
    fig, ax = pitch.draw()

------------------
What is mplsoccer?
------------------

In mplsoccer, you can:

- plot football/soccer pitches on nine different pitch types
- plot radar charts
- plot Nightingale/pizza charts
- plot bumpy charts for showing changes over time
- plot arrows, heatmaps, hexbins, scatter, and (comet) lines
- load StatsBomb data as a tidy dataframe
- standardize pitch coordinates into a single format

I hope mplsoccer helps you make insightful graphics faster,
so you don't have to build charts from scratch.
